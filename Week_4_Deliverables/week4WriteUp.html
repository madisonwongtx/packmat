        <h1>Week 4 Writeup</h1>
        <p>Madison, Ye Cheng, Claire, Michael</p>
        <h2>Goal 1</h2>
        <h3>Reconfigure LCD so users unfamiliar with state diagram understand what is going on</h3>
        <p>
            We wanted to pack the screen of our PackMat to be practical so that users who were probably
            unfamiliar with the state machine diagram could understand what was going on with their PackMat.
            To do this, we created a new file that would have all the tft printing functions. This allowed 
            us to have cleaner code since the state machine diagram code was already quite long. To make this work,
            I passed in the TFT_eSPI object as a parameter to all my helper functions and the key from the keypad if needed.
            Then I went through the different states that require instruction for the user and wrote separate functions for each. For example,
            there are three cases when the keypad is used to enter 4 numbers: unlocking the locked PackMat, 
            setting the passcode upon set up, and turning off the alarm. We thought it would be useful to let users see the numbers
            that they are entering so I created four separate helper functions, one to print each number and then reused them
            for all three cases. I also had the instructional page telling the user to enter the passcode with 4 digits. Finally,
            I had an instruction screen for confirming packages or switching to unlocked mode from locked.

            In order to make the state of the PackMat more clear, we also created displays for the delivery person
            dropping the package off, a signal to show that the security systems have been triggered, as well as locked.

            The goal was met (hooray!)

        <h2>Goal 2</h2>
        <h3>Allow users to set username and password for login</h3>
        <p>
            Using the keypad to code numbers and letters, we wrote helper functions that would sense the key pad in such a way
            that it would add to the username or password a new letter or number. The corresponding letters to the keypad were similar
            to that of a phone(pressing 2 once gives "2", pressing it twice gives "A", pressing it three times gives "B", etc); this is done by Using
            both the numberpad sensing functionality as well as keeping track of the number of presses. A button press
            signifies that we are done entering that letter or number and then a press of a second button means that the entire username or password
            is done. If a different number is pushed without a button press in between, then the new number is ignored(i.e. pressing 2 twice and then pressing three 
            will still keep the current username/password as "A" and the 3 press will be ignored). Similarly, if a button is pressed too many times(i.e. "2" is pressed 6 time), then 
            any additional presses will be ignored(i.e. pressing "2" six times will result in a new letter of "C" and it won't move onto "D").

            The goal was met (hooray!)
        </p>
        <h2>Goal 3</h2>
        <h3>Cleaner/Aesthetic PackMat</h3>
        <p>
            For this weeks deliverable, I was tasked to make the PackMat look cleaner and somewhat more aesthetic. I remember during the second week when 
            Maddison and I were integrating the load cell code to the overall code, a wire connected to the load cell amplifier came off the solder joint 
            so we couldn’t do anything further from there. Additionally, the wires inside the PackMat got tangled up with each other and stuck out of the 
            PackMat which made it really easy for something wrong to happen to the PackMat. This actually happened again during Week 4 when Maddison was 
            working on the PackMat code and when she took out the PackMat all the wires came off the amplifier which I had soldered on. In her defense, the 
            wires from the load cell are extremely thin, so it is very easy for things like this to happen. Before I could make the PackMat more presentable, 
            I had to resolver the wires and make sure the PackMat was working like before. I taped all of the exposed wires coming out from the inside of the 
            PackMat so that they won’t be exposed anymore and get tangled with other wires. I also drew a concept logo on a piece of drawing paper and placed 
            it on the tile where packages will be placed. This makes the PackMat look like a product rather than two tiles stacked on each other. The final 
            design looked pretty good, so I replaced the original PackMat (the one with the green wooden base) with the PackMat I made in Week 3 so we had 
            two identical PackMats. This also adds to the idea that the PackMat is a product rather than having two very different products (Week 1 PackMat vs. Week 3 PackMat).
            There should now be no more potential problems with wiring coming out of the PackMat.
            
            The goal was met (hooray!)
