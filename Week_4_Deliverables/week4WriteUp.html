        <h2>Goal 1</h2>
        <h3>Reconfigure LCD so users unfamiliar with state diagram understand what is going on</h3>
        <p>
            We wanted to pack the screen of our PackMat to be practical so that users who were probably
            unfamiliar with the state machine diagram could understand what was going on with their PackMat.
            To do this, we created a new file that would have all the tft printing functions. This allowed 
            us to have cleaner code since the state machine diagram code was already quite long. To make this work,
            I passed in the TFT_eSPI object as a parameter to all my helper functions and the key from the keypad if needed.
            Then I went through the different states that require instruction for the user and wrote separate functions for each. For example,
            there are three cases when the keypad is used to enter 4 numbers: unlocking the locked PackMat, 
            setting the passcode upon set up, and turning off the alarm. We thought it would be useful to let users see the numbers
            that they are entering so I created four separate helper functions, one to print each number and then reused them
            for all three cases. I also had the instructional page telling the user to enter the passcode with 4 digits. Finally,
            I had an instruction screen for confirming packages or switching to unlocked mode from locked.

            In order to make the state of the PackMat more clear, we also created displays for the delivery person
            dropping the package off, a signal to show that the security systems have been triggered, as well as locked.

            The goal was met (hooray!)
