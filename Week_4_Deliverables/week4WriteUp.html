        <h2>Goal 1</h2>
        <h3>Reconfigure LCD so users unfamiliar with state diagram understand what is going on</h3>
        <p>
            We wanted to pack the screen of our PackMat to be practical so that users who were probably
            unfamiliar with the state machine diagram could understand what was going on with their PackMat.
            To do this, we created a new file that would have all the tft printing functions. This allowed 
            us to have cleaner code since the state machine diagram code was already quite long. To make this work,
            I passed in the TFT_eSPI object as a parameter to all my helper functions and the key from the keypad if needed.
            Then I went through the different states that require instruction for the user and wrote separate functions for each. For example,
            there are three cases when the keypad is used to enter 4 numbers: unlocking the locked PackMat, 
            setting the passcode upon set up, and turning off the alarm. We thought it would be useful to let users see the numbers
            that they are entering so I created four separate helper functions, one to print each number and then reused them
            for all three cases. I also had the instructional page telling the user to enter the passcode with 4 digits. Finally,
            I had an instruction screen for confirming packages or switching to unlocked mode from locked.

            In order to make the state of the PackMat more clear, we also created displays for the delivery person
            dropping the package off, a signal to show that the security systems have been triggered, as well as locked.

            The goal was met (hooray!)

        <h2>Goal 2</h2>
        <h3>Allow users to set username and password for login</h3>
        <p>
            Using the keypad to code numbers and letters, we wrote helper functions that would sense the key pad in such a way
            that it would add to the username or password a new letter or number. The corresponding letters to the keypad were similar
            to that of a phone(pressing 2 once gives "2", pressing it twice gives "A", pressing it three times gives "B", etc); this is done by Using
            both the numberpad sensing functionality as well as keeping track of the number of presses. A button press
            signifies that we are done entering that letter or number and then a press of a second button means that the entire username or password
            is done. If a different number is pushed without a button press in between, then the new number is ignored(i.e. pressing 2 twice and then pressing three 
            will still keep the current username/password as "A" and the 3 press will be ignored). Similarly, if a button is pressed too many times(i.e. "2" is pressed 6 time), then 
            any additional presses will be ignored(i.e. pressing "2" six times will result in a new letter of "C" and it won't move onto "D").

            The goal was met (hooray!)
