        <h2>Goal 1</h2>
        <h3>Make passcode functionality occur once</h3>
        <p>
            Before the current implementation, users would need to enter a passcode every time the states switched from rest state to package confirmation state 1.
            However, we figured that users would probably utilize the same password everytime and probably did not want to come set the passcode everytime they received a new package.
            So the goal was to move the passcode functionality to the beginning where the user would set their password whenever the system started. To do this,
            we just changed the starting state from REST to PM1 which is the first programing mode where users enter the first number of their code. Then after the user enters the 4th number of their
            passcode into the keybad in PM4, instead of switching to LOCKED state, it will now transition to the REST state. The other change we made is that after PC1, if the user confirms package,
            instead of moving to PM1, the state machine will transition to LOCKED state. We moved all four programming modes to the front of the switch statement to make it more logically
            sound and easier for our code to be followed. We also removed the button functionality that was emulating the keypad presses and actually integrated it in with the keypad.

        <h2>Goal 2</h2>
        <h3>Integrate numberpad and alarm into state machine</h3>
        <p>
            Previously, the alarm and numberpad keypresses were simulated with button presses. Now, we integrate the helper functions
            for playing the tone as well as the various other ones used to do put and get requests to the website. By replacing the button 
            presses from before with the code used to sense button presses and incorporating the button presses from the last two weeks' deliverables,
            the numberpad and alarms are appropriately integrated into the state machine. During the alarm states it runs playTone() and runs
            period GET requests to see if the alarm was turned off remotely, and also continually senses the keypad. We also add additional post requests 
            to the states in order to update the website status.

            Now our state machine is entirely accurate, without the need of stand-in buttons

        <h2>Goal 3</h2>
        <h3>Create another packmat platform</h3>
        <p>
            My goal this week was to create another packMat platform to accommodate multiple users. I used the same wiring and setup as my week 1
            deliverable with the only difference being using two slabs instead of wood and a slab, and the wiring is much neater in the sense that
            the wires are not tangled with each other. It looks much more slick than the first platform. The readouts also produce very accurate
            readouts of +/- 1 gram of the true weight of an object. The only thing I would have to do now is store the calibration factor into the 
            second userâ€™s code so that it automatically calibrates and reads upon startup.
