        <h2>Goal 1</h2>
        <h3>Implement load cells and integrate with all states affected by it.</h3>
        <p>
            Following the same successful state diagram that was coded and outlined from the week 1 deliverable, 
            we integrated the load cells. In order to do this, we first took the working code from calibrating the load cells and 
            the working code from the state machine and integrated the two. More specifically, we moved all necessary set up that 
            was in the calibration file into the set up of the state machine code. Then we initialized the necessary global variables
            in the state machine that were needed. Finally, we moved the code that took the actual measurements on the load cells
            from the calibration file to the state machine file in the loop. We initialize two global variables, `curr_weight` and `old_weight`. 
            The `curr_weight` will be updated each time through the loop with the value give by the load cells. The function with 
            our state machine then follows. After calling our state machine code, we set `old_weight' to equal `curr_weight`. So with
            each loop, both `curr_weight` and `old_weight' are updated.
