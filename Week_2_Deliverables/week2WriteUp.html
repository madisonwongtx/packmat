        <h2>Goal 1</h2>
        <h3>Implement load cells and integrate with all states affected by it.</h3>
        <p>
            Following the same successful state diagram that was coded and outlined from the week 1 deliverable, 
            we integrated the load cells. In order to do this, we first took the working code from calibrating the load cells and 
            the working code from the state machine and integrated the two. More specifically, we moved all necessary set up that 
            was in the calibration file into the set up of the state machine code. Then we initialized the necessary global variables
            in the state machine that were needed. Finally, we moved the code that took the actual measurements on the load cells
            from the calibration file to the state machine file in the loop. We initialize three global variables, `curr_weight` and `old_weight`. The 
            third global variable being a constant called `THRESHOLD` to account for the small changes in the load cells despite the stationary state 
            and being the delta needed to surpass in order to trigger a transition to the next state.
            The `curr_weight` will be updated each time through the loop with the value give by the load cells. The function with 
            our state machine then follows. After calling our state machine code, we set `old_weight' to equal `curr_weight`. So with
            each loop, both `curr_weight` and `old_weight' are updated. In between, we call our code for the state machine. The goal of 
            this deliverable is to have the state machine working as described by the state machine diagram but the 
            button emulating the event of pressure increases or decreases is replaced with the actual load cells detecting changes.
            There are three states where we removed the button checks: switching from rest to pacakge confirmation 1 state, switching
            from locked to package confirmation 2 state, and from locked to alarm state. If we were looking for a pressure increase,
            we checked that the `curr_weight`-`old_weight` > THRESHOLD in order to switch states. With pressure decrease, we checked
            that the `old_weight`-`curr_weight` > THRESHOLD in order to change states.

            With the process above, this goal for the week was met (hooray!).
