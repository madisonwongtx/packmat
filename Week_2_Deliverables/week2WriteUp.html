        <h2>Goal 1</h2>
        <h3>Implement load cells and integrate with all states affected by it.</h3>
        <p>
            Following the same successful state diagram that was coded and outlined from the week 1 deliverable, 
            we integrated the load cells. In order to do this, we first took the working code from calibrating the load cells and 
            the working code from the state machine and integrated the two. More specifically, we moved all necessary set up that 
            was in the calibration file into the set up of the state machine code. Then we initialized the necessary global variables
            in the state machine that were needed. Finally, we moved the code that took the actual measurements on the load cells
            from the calibration file to the state machine file in the loop. We initialize three global variables, `curr_weight` and `old_weight`. The 
            third global variable being a constant called `THRESHOLD` to account for the small changes in the load cells despite the stationary state 
            and being the delta needed to surpass in order to trigger a transition to the next state.
            The `curr_weight` will be updated each time through the loop with the value give by the load cells. The function with 
            our state machine then follows. After calling our state machine code, we set `old_weight' to equal `curr_weight`. So with
            each loop, both `curr_weight` and `old_weight' are updated. In between, we call our code for the state machine. The goal of 
            this deliverable is to have the state machine working as described by the state machine diagram but the 
            button emulating the event of pressure increases or decreases is replaced with the actual load cells detecting changes.
            There are three states where we removed the button checks: switching from rest to pacakge confirmation 1 state, switching
            from locked to package confirmation 2 state, and from locked to alarm state. If we were looking for a pressure increase,
            we checked that the `curr_weight`-`old_weight` > THRESHOLD in order to switch states. With pressure decrease, we checked
            that the `old_weight`-`curr_weight` > THRESHOLD in order to change states.

            With the process above, this goal for the week was met (hooray!).

        <h2>Goal 2</h2>
        <h3>Implement Auto Calibration Upon Startup and State Machine Load Cell Integration</h3>
        <p>So last week I used the calibration example code to calibrate the Packmat platform. The inconvenience with this code is that every 
            time upon startup I have to follow the program instructions: tare the slab, place a known weight, press some keys and then store the 
            calibration value. This takes a while. What I ended up doing to calibrate upon start up is to use the calibrate factor obtained previously 
            and hard code that value into LoadCell.setCalFactor. The calibration value I ended up using that got me within a tolerance of a gram is -20.55. 
            This value works really well every time the program runs, so there is no need to do any fancy calculations upon startup. After seeing that the 
            readouts were really close to the true value of the “package”, I worked with Maddison to help integrate the load cell code into her state 
            machine code. The key part of the state machine code was keeping track of the current package weight and comparing that to the old package 
            weight. And depending on whether there is no weight change, and increase in weight, or a decrease in weight will the code go into certain 
            states depending on weight changes. The load cell implementation worked really well as you can see in Maddison’s demo video. 
            Deliverable was met.

        <h2>Goal 3</h2>
        <h3>Allow for remote turn-off of alarm</h3>
        <p>When an incorrect code is inputted, the alarm is turned on and the appropriate post request is sent to the server.
            On the server, there is a prompt that allows for the user to remotely enter in the correct passcode. If the password
            entered on the remote server is correct, then it will turn it's internal state to have alarm_status equal to 1. Thus, the code
            on our ESP32, every set period of time(in this case we are setting it to 1 second), we send a get request to the server in order
            to check whether the alarm status is still on; if the get request results in an alarm status of 0, then that means the correct passcode
            was entered on the server, and we can therefore turn the alarm off on our ESP32. Meanwhile, we still allow for manual entering of the 
            correct passcode on the numberpad, as seen in last week's deliverable. Deliverable is met
