        <h1>PackageMat</h1>
        <h2>A 6.08 project by Madison Wong, Michael Iglesias, Claire Bao, and Ye Cheng Zheng</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Online orders have become an increasing part of modern commerce, so much focus is placed on ensuring that customers receive their deliveries. 
            Delivery firms, especially, use barcodes and scanners to track packages en-route, allowing customers to know the real-time status of their packages. 
            However, upon arrival at their destination, the responsibility of the package is placed on the customer. If the packages cannot be picked up 
            immediately, they will be susceptible to theft. This lack of security on the receiving end is not only a problem for customers, but also sellers,
            who may have to replace or refund missing items. <p>

        <p>To address this problem, we propose Package Mat (PackMat), a security system to monitor delivered packages. PackMat consists of two main 
            components - a physical mat and a web interface. Once a package is delivered, the delivery driver will place the package on the mat and 
            enter a key into the mat’s keypad. The key, which will be stored on the server and is visible on the web interface, must be entered again 
            before removing the package. If the package is moved with a missing or incorrect key, an alarm would immediately sound and the web interface will 
            update, notifying the user of the issue. As a result, while PackMat would not completely prevent theft, it discourages it by alarming the package 
            thief as well as providing a monitoring system for users.</p>

        <h3>Intended Functionality</h3>
        <p>There are several different components in our design that we hope to integrate for the intended functionality of a secure package security system. 
            First, there is the physical package mat or area where the package would lay. Once pressure increases on the mat, the system enters confirmation. 
            If there is not a new package, it returns to the restful state, otherwise it gives the user the opportunity to enter in a code to secure their 
            package through the website. If the pressure changes at any point, an alarm will sound and will alert the user about the possibility of their 
            package being stolen. The only way to turn off the alarm is to enter in the correct password on the package mat or through the website. 
            If the code is entered correctly, the alarms turns off. The user can also enter in the passcode on the package mat when they pick up their 
            package to avoid the alarm. This entire system is described concisely in the system block and state machine diagrams below.</p>

        <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
        <h5>Website:</h5>
        <p>May need to implement security/ login functionality, since a public site allows pass codes to be viewable by anybody</p>
        <p>Might need cookies to maintain login status when refreshing page / moving to different page</p>
        <p>Can compromise with individual proof-of-concept public page if not possible on the 6.08 dev server</p>
        <h5>Server:</h5>
        <p>Might need to agree on some request formats / protocols ahead of time, otherwise changing and editing them will be difficult to manage later on as more code is added.</p>
