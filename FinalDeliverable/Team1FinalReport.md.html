**PackMat - Final Report**

An increasing trend seen in the news is package theft. It has become an increasing problem as users 
try to find ways to keep their packages secure and safe from the thieves. Introducing the PackMat. 
The newest package security system. With the PackMat, users can be assured that their packages will
be safe. To do this, the PackMat platform is made of weight sensing cells that can detect changes in 
weight to the nearest gram. Users will be able to create a username and password
that can be used to control the PackMat from our website. When there is a package delivered, the delivery
man will confirm that there is a package on the platform and therefore it will be in locked mode. In this 
secure state, if there is a change in pressure without entering the password first to unlock the PackMat, 
the alarm will sound alerting the user and the surrounding environment of the theft. The PackMat has 
functionality so that the alarm can be turned off with the keypad on site. From the website, users 
will be able to see the password they have set and when the alarm on the PackMat has gone off. Users 
will also be able to turn off the alarm remotely from the website.
