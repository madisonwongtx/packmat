**PackMat - Final Report**

An increasing trend seen in the news is package theft, which has become a large problem as users 
try to find ways to keep their packages secure and safe. Many have installed cameras on 
their doors but that is usually not enough. 

Introducing PackMat! 
The newest package security system. With PackMat, users can be assured that their packages will
be safe. To do this, the PackMat platform is made of weight sensing cells that can detect changes in 
weight to the nearest gram. Users will be able to create a username and password
that can be used to control the PackMat from our website. When there is a package delivered, the delivery
worker will confirm that there is a package on the platform and therefore it will be in locked mode. In this 
secure state, if there is a change in pressure without entering the password first to unlock the PackMat, 
the alarm will sound alerting the user and the surrounding environment of the theft, similar to a car alarm. 
The PackMat has functionality so that the alarm can be turned off with the keypad on site. From the website, users 
will be able to see the password they have set and when the alarm on the PackMat has gone off. Users 
will also be able to turn off the alarm remotely from the website.

Functionality
===============================================================================
The PackMat begins in a login and passcode setting state. This set up only happens once and then after
enters the main loop of the state machine diagram. The other main modes for the PackMat are Rest, Locked, Alarm, 
and Unlocked. The full state machine diagram and system block diagram is detailed below.

![State Machine Diagram for PackMat](./State_Machine_6.08_Project.jpg)

Login Mode
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once the system is started for the first time, users will be able to create a username and password through
the PackMat using the keypad. The username and password they enter here will allow users to log into their account on our
website so that they can monitor and change the status of their PackMat. If the user has an existing account, they can 
enter their credentials in the same manner and will be logged in without creating a new account.

Program Mode
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After completing the initial login, users will be prompted to create a 4 digit numerical passcode that will be 
utilized in unlocking and turning off the alarm in case of a security breach or package theft. This passcode must be set
on the physical PackMat and can only be set once. This is an added on security measure.

IDLE Mode
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After completing the login and programming of the passcode, the PackMat will remain in IDLE until receiving a package.
The PackMat is looking for an increase in pressure in order to trigger it to lock. Once a delivery man places a package
on to the PackMat, the load cell senses the increase in pressure and asks for confirmation. The delivery man is then 
responsible for confirming with a button so that the PackMat will be locked. 
This ensures that any increase in pressure caused from something other than a package (like a leaf or animal), would not
trigger the locking mechanism to activate.

Locked Mode
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once our PackMat is in locked mode, you can assure that your pacakge is secure. From here, users will have the ability to 
unlock the PackMat, using the password they set in program mode, in order to retrieve their package without setting off the loud
alarm. If there is another package delivered, the delivery person can press a button to add and confirm an additional package (with the PackMat
only allowing increases in weight) without triggering the alarm. On the other hand, if the PackMat detects a decrease in weight, an alarm will 
sound warning the theif and alerting nearby people of the possible theft.

Security Features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to make sure users have the most access to their PackMat, we have created a website where users can monitor
and alter the status of PackMat remotely. If the alarm is to sound and they are not on site with the PackMat, users can login
with the username and password they created when they first received the PackMat. Once logged in, users will be able to enter their
4 digit passcode in order to disarm the alarm remotely. Users will also be able to see the dates and times of when the alarm has gone off
as well as the status of the PackMat (like whether it is locked, meaning users have a package).

LCD interface
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Users will be able to tell what state their PackMat is in with the PackMat's LCD. Here, instructions will be displayed
on how to set their username, password, and four digit passcode as well as instructions for turning off the alarm or unlocking
the PackMat. In order to help users understand what state the PackMat is in, in addition to text instructions,
we have also color coded the states. Red for alarm/security breach, green for unlock mode, and blue for locked. 

Server/Website
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the PackMat [website](https://608dev-2.net/sandbox/sc/yechengz/packmat2/index.html), users can log in with their account
created on the physical mat. Once logged in, users will be able to view their PackMat's status in real-time, showing their 
set passcode, whether the system is active, if the alarm is currently ringing, and previous timestamps of when the alarm has 
been set off. Users can also deactivate the system/alarm by entering their set passcode.

In addition to hosting the website, the server also supports multiple GET/POST requests to update and view PackMat states and
deal with accounts and logins. These are further described in the documentation section.

### HX711_ADC-master/

The scripts in this folder were initially used to test out interfacing with the phototransistors and and the lasers in order to play notes. They are the only code here not run on the ESP32 for the final project.

### src.ino

In this file, all necessary global variables, such as timers, network and request parameters, and input pins for the buzzer and keypad are initialized. Moreover, all necessary setup, such as connecting to the WiFi 
and setting up the keypad and buzzer are done in the setup method(). The loop function is in this file as well, so within each loop, we have code to sense the weight and the loop function calls the packmat function
which contains the state machine. Finally, there is also the playTone() helper function that is used to play the alarm sound on the buzzer.

### packmat_fsm.ino

This file contains the full state machine. The state machine uses the various helper functions, inputs that represent the state of the function as passed in from the loop function, and the curr_weight as caculated in the loop function . 
These values and functions are used to maintain state and perform actions depending on the state we are in

### input_helpers.ino

This file contains two helper functions : userKeyCheck() and passwordKeyCheck(). These helper functions use the state of the keypad to update the user and password variables initiated in src.ino. Hence,
this file contains the helper functions used to update variables based on input, and they are utilized in the packmat_fsm.ino file.

### lcd_helpers.ino

This file contains helper functions that update the LCD screen according to state. This is called in the packmat_fsm.ino file in every state.

### request_helpers.ino

This file has all the helper functions related to sending post and get requests. The main helper function is the do_http_request() function as seen from labs throughout the semester, and this
function uses a separate char_append helper function as well. Next, there are four helper functions that we use directly in packmat_fsm.ino : login(), create_account(), postUpdate(), and checkWebsiteAlarmStatus()
login() and create_account() use the do_http_request helper function to send appropriate post requests to the login and create_account webpages on the server-side. Similarly, we also have checkWebsiteAlarmStatus() and postUpdate().
checkWebsiteAlarmStatus() sends a get request to the main webpage to extract the current alarm status on the server; this is used to allow us to check if the alarm is turned off remotely. Similarly, postUpdate
sends a properly-formatted POST request to the main webpage to update the webpage of a change in alarm status or the system status.

Server Side
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### database.py
This file provides helper functions to interface with the PackMat database, which contains two tables (state_db and accounts_db). For state_db, we have four functions:

* create_table(): creates the state_db file and is called at the beginning of each request if the file has not been made already.
* post_state(user_id, is_active, passcode, alarm_status): takes in four arguments describing the state of PackMat at a given time, and adds a row to state_db with the current timestamp.
* get_latest_state(user_id): takes in a user id and gets the latest PackMat state for that user.
* get_alarm_list(user_id): takes in a user id and gets the list of times when the user's PackMat has triggered its alarm.

For accounts_db, we also have 4 functions:
* create_accounts_table(): creates the accounts_db file and is called at the beginning of each request if the file has not been made already.
* create_account(username, password): creates an account by adding the passed in username, password, and a randomly generated user_id to the accounts_db table
* login(username, password): checks the state_db table for an account with the given username or password and returns the user_id if a match is found.
* check_user_id(user_id): checks the state_db table for a user id and returns True if it exists and False otherwise.

### request_handler.py
Handles a GET and POST request. The GET request takes in a user id and returns the latest PackMat state for the given user. The POST request
takes in a user id, passcode, alarm status (1 or 0), and PackMat active status (1 or 0), and then adds a row to the state_db table with the 
provided data.

### alarms.py
Handles a GET request that takes in a user id and retrieves the history of PackMat alarms setting off for the given user.

### check_passcode.py
Handles a POST request that takes in a user id and passcode. Checks if the passcode of the given user matches and deactivates the system by turning the
is_active and alarm_status off if a match occurs. Returns the latest is_active and alarm_status variable for the user.

### create_account.py
Handles a POST request that takes in a username and password. Creates an account and adds it to accounts_db if the username has not been already made.

### login.py
Handles a POST request taking in a username and password. Returns the user id if username and password matches.

### index.html
HTML for the PackMat website.

### scripts.js
This file handles events (button clicks, form input, etc) and cookies storing login credentials on the website. In addition, it also handles 
GET/POST requests for logging in, retrieving and updating PackMat state, and checking passcodes.

Cookies: We store user ids and usernames locally on the user's browser. This is to ensure that the user doesn't have to repeatedly log in
whenever they refresh the page.

Requests: By default, we send two GET requests repeatedly to the server. One request is sent every second and retrieves the PackMat's current state.
The other is sent every three seconds and retrieves alarm history. In addition, we also send a request for retrieving user ids when logging in
and a request to check passcodes when deactivating the system.

### style.css
Styling sheet (CSS) for the website.
