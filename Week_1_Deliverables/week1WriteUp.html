        <h1>Week 1 Writeup</h1>
        <p>Madison, Ye Cheng, Claire, Michael</p>
        <h1>Goal 1</h1>
        <h2>Complete the initial outline and coding of the full state machine as described in the state machine diagram</h2>
        <p>Similar to past design exercises and because of the complexity of our system, I first drew out a detailed state machine diagram in order to lay out my different states and 
           what caused transitions to different states. Once there was a clear vision of how we wanted PackMat to work, I implemented the outline of it in C++. My goal 
           for this week was to take the completed state machine and put it into code. Because I did not have any of the hardware pieces (as my team figured it would be easiest
           to work on separately in parallel and then integrate), I utilized buttons in place of events. For example, pushing button in pin 39 signaled a pressure increase. 
           With this, I utilized Serial print statements in order to show what state the system was currently in, what caused the state transition, and the state it would be switching to.
           The purpose of the switch statements was to ensure that the logic of my code matched the logic of the drawn out state machine so that when it came time to integrate the necessary 
           hardware, it would be much easier as well as make it easier on us to debug. One issue I did run into was really bad button bouncing and because I had limited buttons,
           I was forced to use the same button for multiple events/changes. In order to solve this issue, I did input delays between state changes because these buttons will not actually 
           be utilized in our final design so button bouncing will not be an issue. 
           
           With the process above, this goal for week 1 was met (hooray!).
        </p>
        <h1>Goal 2</h1>
        <h2>Complete the alarm and numberpad input functions</h2>
        <p>The goal of this first week was to start writing functions that could then be used as modular components within the 
            state machine. Specifically, we wrote a function, checkCode() that is run every loop iteration. This function checks to see
            if there has been a numerical key pressed("A","B","C","D","*", and "#" are ignored). If so, it adds to the current integer array
            representing the current code. Also, if it sees that 4 numbers have been entered, it marks as done(which can then be checked in the state machine) 
            and resets the code entered. This done marker can be used in the state machine to check whether there is a code entered and also
            whether the code entered was correct or incorrect. 

            For week 1, we start with a hard-coded correct passcode. But this can easily be changed to be the result of the initial checkCode() loops.

            The other function that we wrote was playTone() which plays one iteration of the alarm tone. In order to show this in the deliverable,
            we coded another function playAlarm() that takes in a time to play the tone and continually plays the tone for that amount of time. Another thing to note
            is that the playTone checks to make sure a global "alarm" variable is still set to 1 when it plays the tone. Thus, theoretically, if somewhere
            else in the code alarm is set to 0, it should stop the tone.

            These two functions combined with a simple if loop allow the arduino to play a tone for 5 seconds when the entered passcode is "1234", which is 
            the hard-coded "correct passcode".

            We've also added a post request in the proper format to our server code to alert the server that the alarm has been triggered.
           
           With the process above, this goal for week 1 was met (hooray!).
        </p>
        <h1>Goal 3</h1>
        <h2>Create persistent storage and handling for passcode and alarm statuses</h2>
        <p>
            This week's goal on the server side was to first create an SQL table for passcode and alarm updates, as well as request handlers to interact with the table.
            I also implemented an auto-updating site that displays the current passcode and alarm status of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            To implement the server, I used SQLite3 to create a table with the columns rec_time (datetime), user (text), is_active(BIT), passcode (text), and alarm_status (BIT).
            The user and is_active columns will be used in future deliverables when implementing activation of the system and different users. This time, the demo 
            mostly focuses on the passcode and alarm_status columns. The current possible requests are the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            POST request: updates the SQL table with current status of system. To POST to the server, we can send a request to https://608dev-2.net/sandbox/sc/yechengz/packmat/request_handler.py 
            with an x-www-form-urlencoded body of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>is_active: 0 or 1 - 1 if the Packmat system is active, 0 otherwise</li>
                <li>alarm_status: 0 or 1 - 1 if alarm is active; 0 otherwise</li>
                <li>passcode: numerical string - passcode to unlock packmat</li>
            </ul>
            
            GET request: gets the latest status of the system. To GET, send a request to 
            <a href="https://608dev-2.net/sandbox/sc/yechengz/packmat/request_handler.py">https://608dev-2.net/sandbox/sc/yechengz/packmat/request_handler.py</a> 
            without any params. The response will contain the above parameters and their latest values in JSON. You can click on the link to see the latest response.
        </p>
        <p>
            To implement the POST request, I first took the values from the request body, got the latest time with Datetime, and then made an INSERT query to the table
            with a hardcoded user. To implement the GET request, I made a SELECT query for the row with the latest time and returned the result in JSON format.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the server, we also added a basic auto-updating site to display the current Packmat status. 
            The site (<a href="https://608dev-2.net/sandbox/sc/yechengz/packmat/index.html">https://608dev-2.net/sandbox/sc/yechengz/packmat/index.html</a>) was implemented with HTML. 
            Ajax was used in the script (scripts.js) to send a GET request every second to the request handler, allowing the site to update whenever 
            the SQL table is updated, without needing to refresh the page.
